NAME
    RTx::Calendar - Calendar for RT due dates

DESCRIPTION
    This RT extension provides a calendar view for your tickets and your
    reminders so you see when is your next due ticket. You can find it in
    ticket search sub navigation menu.

    Date fields in the search results are displayed/used in the calendar,
    for example if you have a ticket with a due date, it won't be displayed
    on that date unless the Due field is included in the search result
    format.

    There's a portlet to put on your home page (see Prefs/MyRT.html), see
    the CONFIGURATION section below for details on adding it.

RT VERSION
    Works with RT 5.

    If you need to install this for RT 4.4.x, install version 1.05:

        cpanm RTx::Calendar@1.05

INSTALLATION
    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make install
        May need root permissions

    Edit your /opt/rt5/etc/RT_SiteConfig.pm
        Add this line:

            Plugin('RTx::Calendar');

    Clear your mason cache
            rm -rf /opt/rt5/var/mason_data/obj

    Restart your webserver

CONFIGURATION
  Use the calendar on Dashboard
    The calendar comes with 3 different portlets that can be added to your
    RT dashboards:

    MyCalendar, a summary of the events for the current week.
    Calendar, a full month of the calendar view, without sidebar.
    CalendarWithSidebar, a full month of the calendar view, with sidebar
    which includes an extra status filter and legends of the calendars.

    $HomepageComponents in etc/RT_SiteConfig.pm:

      Set($HomepageComponents, [qw(QuickCreate Quicksearch
         MyCalendar Calendar CalendarWithSidebar
         MyAdminQueues MySupportQueues MyReminders RefreshHomepage)]);

  Display configuration
   Displaying the owner
    You can show the owner in each day box by adding this line to your
    etc/RT_SiteConfig.pm:

        Set($CalendarDisplayOwner, 1);

   Choosing the fields to be displayed in the popup
    When you mouse over events on the calendar, a popup window shows
    additional details from the ticket associated with that event. You can
    configure which fields are displayed with @CalendarPopupFields. This is
    the default configuration:

        Set(@CalendarPopupFields, (
            "OwnerObj->Name",
            "CreatedObj->ISO",
            "StartsObj->ISO",
            "StartedObj->ISO",
            "LastUpdatedObj->ISO",
            "DueObj->ISO",
            "ResolvedObj->ISO",
            "Status",
            "Priority",
            "Requestors->MemberEmailAddressesAsString",
        ));

    To show custom field values, add them using the custom field name in
    this format: "CustomField.{Maintenance Start}".

    Valid values are all fields on an RT ticket. See the RT documentation
    for RT::Ticket for a list.

    As shown above, for ticket fields that can have multiple output formats,
    like dates and users, you can also use the Obj associated with the field
    to call a specific method to display the format you want. The ticket
    dates shown above will display dates in ISO format. The documentation
    for RT::Date has other format options. User fields, like Owner, can use
    the methods shown in the RT::User documentation to show values like
    EmailAddress or RealName, for example.

   Event colors
    It's also possible to change the color of the events in the calendar by
    adding the $CalendarStatusColorMap setting to your etc/RT_SiteConfig.pm:

        Set(%CalendarStatusColorMap, (
            'new'                                   => 'blue',
            'open'                                  => 'blue',
            'approved'                              => 'green',
            'rejected'                              => 'red',
            'resolved'                              => '#aaa',
        ));

    You can use any color declaration that CSS supports, including hex
    codes, color names, and RGB values.

   Event filtering by status
    You can change the statuses available for filtering on the calendar by
    adding the @CalendarFilterStatuses setting to your etc/RT_SiteConfig.pm:

        Set(@CalendarFilterStatuses, qw(new open stalled rejected resolved));

   Default selected status on Filtering on Status field
    You can change the default selected statuses by adding them to the
    @CalendarFilterDefaultStatuses setting to your etc/RT_SiteConfig.pm:

        Set(@CalendarFilterDefaultStatuses, qw(new open));

   Custom icons
    Custom Icons can be defined for the events in the calendar by adding the
    $CalendarIcons setting to your etc/RT_SiteConfig.pm:

        Set(%CalendarIcons, (
            'CF.{Maintenance Estimated Start Date/Time - ET}'
                => 'maint.png',
        ));

    The images should be placed on local/static/images.

   Multiple days events
    You can define multiple days events by adding the
    %CalendarMultipleDaysEvents setting to your etc/RT_SiteConfig.pm:

        Set( %CalendarMultipleDaysEvents, (
                'Maintenance' => {
                    'Starts' => 'Starts',
                    'Ends'   => 'Due',
                },
            )
        );

    Note that the Starts and Ends fields must be included in the search
    result Format in order the event to be displayed on the calendar.
