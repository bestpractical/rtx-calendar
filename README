NAME
    RTx::Calendar - Calendar for RT due dates

DESCRIPTION
    This RT extension provides a calendar view for your tickets and your
    reminders so you see when is your next due ticket. You can find it in
    ticket search sub navigation menu.

    Date fields in the search results are displayed/used in the calendar,
    for example if you have a ticket with a due date, it won't be displayed
    on that date unless the Due field is included in the search result
    format.

    There's a portlet to put on your home page (see Prefs/MyRT.html), see
    the CONFIGURATION section below for details on adding it.
