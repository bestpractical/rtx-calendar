NAME
    RTx::Calendar - Calendar for RT due tasks

DESCRIPTION
    This RT extension provides a calendar view for your tickets and your
    reminders so you see when is your next due ticket. You can find it in
    the menu Search->Calendar.

    There's a portlet to put on your home page (see Prefs/MyRT.html)

INSTALLATION
    If you upgrade from 0.02, see next part before.

    You need to install those two modules :

      * DateTime::Set

    Install it like a standard perl module

     perl Makefile.PL
     make
     make install

    If your RT is not in the default path (/opt/rt3) you must set RTHOME
    before doing the Makefile.PL

CONFIGURATION
  Base configuration
    In RT 3.8 and later, to enable calendar plugin, you must add something
    like that in your etc/RT_SiteConfig.pm :

      Set(@Plugins,(qw(RTx::Calendar)));

    To use MyCalendar portlet you must add MyCalendar to $HomepageComponents
    in etc/RT_SiteConfig.pm like that :

      Set($HomepageComponents, [qw(QuickCreate Quicksearch MyCalendar
         MyAdminQueues MySupportQueues MyReminders RefreshHomepage)]);

  Display configuration
    You can show the owner in each day box by adding this line to your
    etc/RT_SiteConfig.pm :

        Set($CalendarDisplayOwner, 1);

    You can change which fields show up in the popup display when you mouse
    over a date in etc/RT_SiteConfig.pm :

        @CalendarPopupFields = ('Status', 'OwnerObj->Name', 'DueObj->ISO');

USAGE
    A small help section is available in /Prefs/Calendar.html

UPGRADE FROM 0.02
    As I've change directory structure, if you upgrade from 0.02 you need to
    delete old files manually. Go in RTHOME/share/html (by default
    /opt/rt3/share/html) and delete those files :

      rm -rf Callbacks/RTx-Calendar
      rm Tools/Calendar.html

    RTx-Calendar may work without this but it's not very clean.

BUGS
    All bugs should be reported via
    <http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Dist/Display.html?Name=RTx-Calendar> or
