NAME
    RTx::Calendar - Calendar for RT due tasks

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.07 of RTx::Calendar

DESCRIPTION
    This RT extension provides a calendar view for your tickets and your
    reminders so you see when is your next due ticket. You can find it in
    the menu Search->Calendar.

    There's a portlet to put on your home page (see Prefs/MyRT.html)

    You can also enable ics (ICal) feeds for your default calendar and all
    your private searches in Prefs/Calendar.html. Authentication is magic
    number based so that you can give those feeds to other people.

INSTALLATION
    If you upgrade from 0.02, see next part before.

    You need to install those three modules :

      * Date::ICal
      * Data::ICal
      * DateTime::Set

    Install it like a standard perl module

     perl Makefile.PL
     make
     make install

    If your RT is not in the default path (/opt/rt3) you must set RTHOME
    before doing the Makefile.PL

CONFIGURATION
  Base configuration
    In RT 3.8 and later, to enable calendar plugin, you must add something
    like that in your etc/RT_SiteConfig.pm :

      Set(@Plugins,(qw(RTx::Calendar)));

    To use MyCalendar portlet you must add MyCalendar to $HomepageComponents
    in etc/RT_SiteConfig.pm like that :

      Set($HomepageComponents, [qw(QuickCreate Quicksearch MyCalendar
         MyAdminQueues MySupportQueues MyReminders RefreshHomepage)]);

    To enable private searches ICal feeds, you need to give
    CreateSavedSearch and LoadSavedSearch rights to your users.

  Display configuration
    You can show the owner in each day box by adding this line to your
    etc/RT_SiteConfig.pm :

        Set($CalendarDisplayOwner, 1);

    You can change which fields show up in the popup display when you mouse
    over a date in etc/RT_SiteConfig.pm :

        @CalendarPopupFields = ('Status', 'OwnerObj->Name', 'DueObj->ISO');

  ICAL feed configuration
    By default, tickets are todo and reminders event. You can change this by
    setting $RT::ICalTicketType and $RT::ICalReminderType in
    etc/RT_SiteConfig.pm :

      Set($ICalTicketType,   "Data::ICal::Entry::Event");
      Set($ICalReminderType ,"Data::ICal::Entry::Todo");

USAGE
    A small help section is available in /Prefs/Calendar.html

UPGRADE FROM 0.02
    As I've change directory structure, if you upgrade from 0.02 you need to
    delete old files manually. Go in RTHOME/share/html (by default
    /opt/rt3/share/html) and delete those files :

      rm -rf Callbacks/RTx-Calendar
      rm Tools/Calendar.html

    RTx-Calendar may work without this but it's not very clean.

BUGS
    *   compatible only with RT 3.6 for the moment. If someone need
        compatibility with 3.4 I can work on this. And I will work on 3.7
        compatibility later.
