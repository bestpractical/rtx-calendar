NAME
    RTx::Calendar - Calendar for RT due dates

DESCRIPTION
    This RT extension provides a calendar view for your tickets and your
    reminders so you see when is your next due ticket. You can find it in
    ticket search sub navigation menu.

    Date fields in the search results are displayed/used in the calendar,
    for example if you have a ticket with a due date, it won't be displayed
    on that date unless the Due field is included in the search result
    format.

    There's a portlet to put on your home page (see Prefs/MyRT.html), see
    the CONFIGURATION section below for details on adding it.

CONFIGURATION
  Base configuration
    To use the MyCalendar portlet, you must add MyCalendar to
    $HomepageComponents in etc/RT_SiteConfig.pm:

      Set($HomepageComponents, [qw(QuickCreate Quicksearch MyCalendar
         MyAdminQueues MySupportQueues MyReminders RefreshHomepage)]);

  Display configuration
   Displaying the owner
    You can show the owner in each day box by adding this line to your
    etc/RT_SiteConfig.pm:

        Set($CalendarDisplayOwner, 1);

   Choosing the fields to be displayed in the popup
    You can change which fields show up in the popup display when you mouse
    over a date in etc/RT_SiteConfig.pm:

        Set(@CalendarPopupFields,
            ('Status',
             'OwnerObj->Name',
             'DueObj->ISO',
             'CustomField.{Maintenance Estimated Start Date/Time - ET}'));

   Event sorting
    You can set the order that the events will presented in the day cell
    with the $CalendarSortEvents setting.

    This setting takes a subroutine reference that will receive an array of
    RT::Ticket objects and should return a sorted array of RT::Ticket.

    The following example sorts the events by status:

        Set($CalendarSortEvents, sub {
            my @Tickets = @_;
            my @SortedTickets = sort { lc($a->Status) cmp lc($b->Status) } @Tickets;
            return @SortedTickets;
        });

   Event colors
    It's also possible to change the color of the events in the calendar by
    adding the $CalendarStatusColorMap setting to your etc/RT_SiteConfig.pm:

        Set(%CalendarStatusColorMap, (
            'new'                                   => 'blue',
            'open'                                  => 'blue',
            'approved'                              => 'green',
            'rejected'                              => 'red',
            'resolved'                              => '#aaa',
        ));

    You can use any color declaration that CSS supports, including hex
    codes, color names, and RGB values.

   Event filtering by status
    You can change the statuses available for filtering on the calendar by
    adding the @CalendarFilterStatuses setting to your etc/RT_SiteConfig.pm:

        Set(@CalendarFilterStatuses, qw(new open stalled rejected resolved));

   Custom icons
    Custom Icons can be defined for the events in the calendar by adding the
    $CalendarIcons setting to your etc/RT_SiteConfig.pm:

        Set(%CalendarIcons, (
            'CF.{Maintenance Estimated Start Date/Time - ET}'
                => 'maint.png',
        ));

    The images should be placed on local/static/images.
